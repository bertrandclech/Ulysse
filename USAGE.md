It uses the Last Backup performed by Ulysse on user request see UlysseApp Preferences -> Backups

## Usage

After installation, check the Ulysse command is available by typing :
$ which Ulysse
Should return something like
> Ulysse is /usr/local/bin/Ulysse
Then run the Ulysse command
$ Ulysse
If a backup of Ulysse Notes has been performed before, in the user homedir you should see your notes layout in public/MD
$ cd
$ ls public/MD

> BoÃ®te pour tout                    Trash-ultrash
> Sur mon Mac                        Ubiquitous Library.ulstoragebackup
